# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to launch my personal website! This is a space where I'll be sharing my thoughts, learnings, and projects as I continue my journey in software engineering.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is organized into several sections:

### Blog Posts
This is where you are now! I'll write longer-form content here including:
- Technical tutorials and guides
- Deep dives into technologies I'm learning
- Best practices and lessons learned
- Project retrospectives

### TIL (Today I Learned)
Short, focused posts documenting daily discoveries. These are intentionally brief - think of them as public learning notes. You'll find:
- Code snippets that solved problems
- Quick tips and tricks
- "Aha!" moments worth remembering

### Projects
A portfolio showcase of software projects I've built, complete with:
- Technical details and stack information
- Problem-solving approaches
- Links to live demos and source code

### Links
Curated resources including apps I've built and blogs I recommend.

## How This Site Is Built

This site is built with:
- **Jekyll**: A static site generator that turns Markdown into HTML
- **Minimal Mistakes**: A clean, responsive Jekyll theme
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting from GitHub
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment on every push

### Why Jekyll and GitHub Pages?

I chose this tech stack because:

1. **Simple and Free**: GitHub Pages offers free hosting with custom domain support
2. **Markdown-Based**: I can write content in Markdown and focus on writing, not formatting
3. **Version Controlled**: Every change is tracked in Git
4. **Portable**: It's just static files - I can move to any host anytime
5. **Fast**: No database, no server-side processing - just fast, secure HTML

## LLM Discoverability

One interesting aspect of this site is that it's optimized for LLM (Large Language Model) discoverability. Inspired by [Cassidy Williams' approach](https://cassidoo.co/post/ai-llm-discoverability/), I've implemented:

- **`/llms.txt`**: A machine-readable file that helps AI tools understand my site structure
- **`/for-llms` page**: Human-readable documentation for AI assistants
- **Schema.org structured data**: JSON-LD markup for better content understanding

This means when AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT reference my content, they can do so more accurately and with better context.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:
- Software engineering practices and patterns
- Technologies I'm working with
- Developer tools and productivity
- Learning experiences and growth
